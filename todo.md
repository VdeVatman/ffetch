###To do list
=============
* Check if there is already a file or directory with the name we will get after turning the files' and firectories' spaces
into _  for each file or directory we would need to change its name. i.e.:
	- we have this file: this\ is\ a\ test\ file.someextension
	- but there already exists a file or directory with this_is_a_test_file.someextension as its name.
* Add colors for warning.
* Add an algorithm for extra complexity in fuzzy searchs that could give you some similar possiblities to what you are 
looking for.
